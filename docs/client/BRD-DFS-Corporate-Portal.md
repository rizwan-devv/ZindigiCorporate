## 1. Executive summary

Zindigi Corporate Portal is a **standalone digital channel** for **corporate / entity** customer onboarding and day-2 operations for an EMI / digital financial services (DFS) environment. It enables remote entity KYC aligned to the **SBP Consolidated Customer Onboarding Framework**, admin compliance review, corporate account provisioning into the DFS Agent platform, and post-activation services (balance, statement, cards, franchise network, maker–checker approvals).

This BRD defines **why** the product exists, **who** it serves, **what** business outcomes are required, and **what is in / out of scope** for the current release presented to the Bank / EMI client.

> **Compliance note:** The current release is **framework-shaped and operational** for digital entity onboarding. Live NADRA Biometric/Verisys and automated sanctions-list vendor integrations are **stubbed / manual**. Full production compliance go-live is **TBD** pending client and vendor wiring.

## 2. Business context & problem statement

### 2.1 Context

Banks and EMIs must onboard **legal entities** (not only natural persons) through remote digital channels under SBP frameworks, with documented CDD, Annex-C evidence, sanctions/identity controls, TAT, and auditability. After activation, corporate customers need a controlled portal for treasury-style visibility and network (franchise / sub-merchant) management with dual-control workflows.

### 2.2 Problem

| Pain | Impact |
|------|--------|
| Manual / paper-heavy corporate onboarding | Slow TAT, inconsistent packs, high ops cost |
| Fragmented partner / beneficial-person KYC | Incomplete files, compliance risk |
| Weak digital audit trail (IP, geo, decisions) | Harder supervision & dispute handling |
| No unified post-activation corporate portal | Balance/statement/cards/network split across tools |
| Insufficient maker–checker for sensitive actions | Operational & fraud control gaps |

### 2.3 Solution summary

Provide one branded portal and supporting mobile KYC path that:

1. Captures entity CDD + Annex-C documents  
2. Collects partner personal KYC via mobile app where required  
3. Routes cases to platform admin for screening & decision  
4. Provisions DFS corporate / agent accounts on approval  
5. Offers activated merchants balance, statement, cards, franchise invites, and approval workflows
