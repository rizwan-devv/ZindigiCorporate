# Zindigi Corporate — Project & KYC Guide

## 1. What is this project?

**Zindigi Corporate** is a **standalone** digital onboarding product (separate from Paybridge) for **entity / corporate accounts only**.

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Location | `d:\Karsaaz\Zindigi-Corporate\` |
| Backend | Spring Boot 3.3 · Java 21 · JWT · Flyway · H2 (dev) · port **8090** |
| Frontend | Vite + React + TypeScript · DFS Connect dark theme · port **5173/5174** |

| Paybridge | **Reference only — not modified** |

### What it does
1. Applicant signs up (entity account type)  
2. Verifies email with OTP (2FA)  
3. Completes **entity KYC** per SBP Consolidated Customer Onboarding Framework  
4. Uploads **Annex-C** documents  
5. Submits → gets **Tracking ID** · **5 working-day TAT**  
6. Admin reviews (sanctions / identity / docs) → approve → login credentials emailed  

### What it does **not** do (yet)
- Natural-person retail wallets (Framework §D)  
- Live NADRA Biometric / Verisys APIs (stubbed for manual/admin)  
- Automated UNSC/ATA list vendor (manual CLEAR by admin)

## 2. Which regulations / KYC framework?

Primary: **SBP Consolidated Customer Onboarding Framework**

| Section | How Zindigi Corporate uses it |
|---------|---------------------------|
| **§B** Applicability | EMIs / digital REs — remote digital channel |
| **§C** Remote onboarding | Website portal; CNIC/NICOP/POC/POR/ARC holders for persons |
| **§E** Entity opening | Full Table-B style entity fields + associated persons |
| **Annex-C** | Document packs for **4 entity types only**: Sole Prop, Small Business, Partnership, LLP |
| **§F.1** Identity verification | Status workflow: PENDING → DEBIT_BLOCKED → admin WAIVED_MANUAL / future BV |
| **§F.3** Location | Captures **IP** + browser **geo** (if allowed) |
| **§F.4** Sanctions | Pre-screening status PENDING → MANUAL_REVIEW → admin CLEAR / HIT |
| **§G** EDD | Risk rating LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH; HIGH requires video KYC ref or EDD notes |
| **§I** TAT | Entity decision due in **5 working days**; Tracking ID; reject reason in writing |
| **§J** Facilitation | Draft resume window **30 days**; step progress pills |

Also informed by **EMI Regulations (2019/2023)** for EMI context (wallet limits still out of scope).

## 3. End-to-end applicant journey

```
Signup → OTP → Entity form (§E) → Persons / Partner invites → Annex-C docs
    → EDD (if HIGH) → Submit (Tracking ID + TAT) → Admin decision → Login
```

### Partner KYC (Partnership / LLP)
1. Lead selects **Partnership** or **LLP** and saves entity details.  
2. Lead adds each **partner** (name + phone + email) on the roster.  
3. After submit, each partner gets a **mobile app** invite (phone + temp PIN).  
4. Partners complete OTP + biometric KYC in the app themselves.  
5. Lead uploads firm docs (deed, authority, registration/SECP).  
6. Submit / pending approval when all partner app KYCs are COMPLETED.

### Sole prop / small business
- **No authorized-person CDD** on the portal.  
- Owner is the applicant (`applicantIsPartner` forced on).  
- Owner completes KYC in the mobile app after submit.  

### Statuses
`DRAFT` → `PENDING_APPROVAL` → `ACTIVE` | `REJECTED`

### Seed admin
`admin@zindigicorp.local` / `Admin@123`

### Local mail
`app.mail.enabled=false` → OTP, passwords, and **partner KYC links** appear in **backend logs**.

## 4. Entity KYC data collected (§E)

### Entity types in scope
1. Sole Proprietorship  
2. Small business / freelance  
3. Partnership (optional “unregistered” flag → skips Registrar cert)  
4. LLP  

### Entity

### Associated natural persons

## 7. Compliance honesty

This release is **framework-shaped and operational for digital entity onboarding**, with **stubs** where NADRA/screening vendors are required. It is **not** a claim of full production go-live compliance until BV/Verisys and automated sanctions are wired.
